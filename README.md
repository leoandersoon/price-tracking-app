# Price Tracking App
This app is providing you to track some online products' prices via GMAIL.

# Libraries
Here are libraries that you'll need in that project;
1. requests
We need that library to web scrapping.
`python -m pip install requests

2. smtplib <br>
So we will have some scrapped prices. And we need to send those data to a mail adress. We need that library to acces SMTP.
_The smtplib library is already a standard package of Python. I mean, if you have Python in your machine, you'll alrady have that library._

3. BeautifulSoap
Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
`pip install beautifulsoup4`

Sincerely,
