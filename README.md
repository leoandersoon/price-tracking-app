# Price Tracking App
_variables and descriptions of that code is in Turkish language. but we're working on translate them into English._ <br>
This app is providing you to track some online products' prices via GMAIL.





# Libraries
Here are libraries that you'll need in that project; <br>

1. requests <br>
We need that library to web scrapping. <br>

.. code-block:: console

    $ `pip install requests`



2. smtplib <br>
So we will have some scrapped prices. And we need to send those data to a mail adress. We need that library to acces SMTP. <br>
_The smtplib library is already a standard package of Python. I mean, if you have Python in your machine, you'll alrady have that library._



3. BeautifulSoap <br>
Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. <br>

.. code-block:: console

    $ `pip install beautifulsoup4


_Sincerely,_
